The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar install`.

If Composer is installed globally, run
```bash
composer install

You should now be able to visit the path to where you installed the app and see the default home page.

configuration relevant for your application.
